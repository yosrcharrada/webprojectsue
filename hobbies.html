              My hobbies are not merely diversions but integral aspects of my identity. Among them, painting and pottery hold a special place, serving as my outlets for creativity and self-expression. In the strokes of painting, emotions find a canvas, and colors weave stories beyond words. Simultaneously, pottery transforms raw clay into tangible forms, blending craftsmanship with a hands-on experience. These pursuits transcend mere pastimes; they are my dedicated retreats, fostering balance and mindfulness amid the professional landscape. Rooted in a commitment to holistic well-being, they bring a unique, enriching perspective to both my personal and professional spheres.
